<br>The name of my home town is <b>DHAKA</b> The capital of  <b>Bangladesh.</b> It is the country's largest and most important city. known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and rapid urbanization. </br><p>Dhaka is a place where tradition meets modernity. From the historic landmarks of Lalbagh Fort and Ahsan Manzil to the towering skyscrapers and shopping malls, the city is always alive with energy. It is famous for its delicious street food, the colorful celebrations of Pohela Boishakh, and its countless rickshaws navigating through busy roads.
